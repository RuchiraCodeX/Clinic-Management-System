    <p>Health is one of the most basic need of a human. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”. Sri Lanka has achieved strong health outcomes over and above what is commensurate with its income level. The country has made significant gains in essential health indicators, witnessed a steady increase in life expectancy among its people, and eliminated malaria, filariasis, polio and neonatal tetanus. </p>
